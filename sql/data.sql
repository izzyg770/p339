    (1, 1, 'Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn''t see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.'),
    (2, 1, 'At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.'),
    (3, 2, 'Fitz is a boston terrior. He loves chasing tennis balls, chipmunks, squirrels, and birds. He is often found sitting by the fire in wintertime and in sun patches when available. He''s energetic, mischievious, and easily bored. He loves people and gets grumpy if left without a lap too long.'),
    (4, 2, 'Fitz loves barking up trees, running aorund on the lawn, and digging in the dirt looking for moles. He especially likes getting treats and whines when he comes inside and doesn''t get a snack.'),
    (5, 3, 'Pluto is a five year old rescue dog of an unknown breed. He was found wandering alone and taken to the Valley Humane Society where he found his new family. From a young age, Pluto always had a special personality, he was known for being very very lazy! He spends most of his time staring out the window to keep watch of his house. Don''t let the laziness fool you because Pluto defends his family from the mailman and squirrels every single day.'),
    (6, 3, 'Aside from his job as defender of the house, Pluto likes to have fun. Pluto''s favorite part of the day is his daily walk. Sometimes he even gets to go to the park and meet his neighbors. He also loves his toy duck, and only his toy duck. As a dog, it''s in his nature to hunt and so he makes sure to get some practice with his toy duck.'),
    (7, 4, 'Sage is a 3 year old Golden Retriever. She is one of the laziest dogs. She loves sneaking into the bedroom and hopping onto the neatest bed. She also loves riding in a car with the windows open feeling the wind and air. She enjoys walking, only if you take her for a ride to a big arboretum or park. Walking around the neighborhood is not necessarily her cup of tea.'),
    (8, 4, 'Her favorite food is corn. One day, she stole corn on the cob from the dining table, which was surprising because she is normally gentle and polite. She took the stolen corn to the patio and enjoyed her meal by herself. Unfortunately, the corn turned out to be unripe, so she ended up vomiting it all later.'),
    (9, 5, 'Smoothie has been dubbed the "world''s most photogenic cat", and her emerald eyes and golden fur have even inspired a mural in New Zealand. Smoothie also has an aptly-named brother named Milkshake, and the two are often featured together across social media platforms.'),

Yellowstone was the first national park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the first national park in the world. The park is known for its wildlife and its many geothermal features, especially the Old Faithful geyser, one of its most popular. While it represents many types of biomes, the subalpine forest is the most abundant. It is part of the South Central Rockies forests ecoregion.'),
    (2, 1, 'Yellowstone National Park spans an area of 3,468.4 sq mi (8,983 km2), comprising lakes, canyons, rivers, and mountain ranges. Yellowstone Lake is one of the largest high-elevation lakes in North America and is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest super volcano on the continent. The caldera is considered a dormant volcano. It has erupted with tremendous force several times in the last two million years. Well over half of the world''s geysers and hydrothermal features are in Yellowstone, fueled by this ongoing volcanism. Lava flows and rocks from volcanic eruptions cover most of the land area of Yellowstone.

In 1978, Yellowstone was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site.'),
